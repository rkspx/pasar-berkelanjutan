# **Individual Test Brief**

# ---

# **Objective:**

As part of the Group Final Project, each individual will complete a solo task that serves as a building block for their team. You may choose to focus on either **Front-End** or **Back-End**, depending on your interest and strengths. This test evaluates both your technical implementation and your ability to design a logical, user-centered system.

---

# **Project Overview:**

You will develop a core component of the **Sustainable Community Market Platform** — a web-based platform that connects local communities to sustainable products. Your work will be reused and further developed in the group project, so it should be clean, modular, and ready for integration.

# **Focus Options:**

1. ## **Front-End Track**

**Scope of Work:**

* **User Flow Design**  
  Design the **user experience flow** of the platform, starting from account registration and ending at checkout. Think critically about each step a user takes, what challenges might occur, and how to ensure a smooth experience.  
* **Front-End Implementation**  
  Build the interface based on your user flow. You may simulate data and use mock back-end solutions. Your app should include, at minimum, these key experiences:  
  * **User Authentication & Authorization**  
  * **Landing Page & Market Discovery**  
  * **Product Details Page**  
  * **Cart & Checkout Page**

2. ## **Back-End Track**

**Scope of Work:**

* **Database Schema Design**  
  Design the **database schema** that will support the platform’s core features. Your schema should account for user management, product listing, cart handling, and order processing. Present your design using any diagram tool.  
* **Back-End Implementation**  
  Based on your schema, implement the back-end logic and API to power the platform. At a minimum, consider building endpoints or logic that support the following features:  
  * **APIs**  
  * **User Data**  
  * **Product Data**  
  * **Transaction Data**

# **Deliverables:**

1. GitHub repository with organized project files.  
2. README.md with documentation and setup instructions.  
3. Live demo (hosted on any platform).  
4. **5-minute recorded presentation video** including:  
   1. Your **user flow** (Front-End) or **database schema** (Back-End)  
   2. Brief explanation of what you built and why  
   3. Key considerations in your design and implementation choices  
5. Submit your GitHub repository, live demo link, and five minute recorded presentation video [**HERE**](https://forms.gle/vFxTM2Sn6T3VFA1z6)**.**

# **Notes:**

* This is an **individual task**, but the outcome will be useful for your group project.  
* Think **creatively and critically** — how would you design a system that’s efficient, user-friendly, and easy to maintain?  
* Focus on **clarity of thought** and **intentional design choices**, not just building what’s expected.  
* There is **no single correct solution** — your reasoning and approach are just as important as the result.
